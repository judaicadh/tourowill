# Judah Touro's Will
Judah Touro (June 16, 1775 – January 18, 1854) was an American businessman and philanthropist. In his will, he bequeathed $500,000 to institutions around the country—more than half of which went to non-Jewish causes. (As a percentage of GDP, these gifts would approximate $2 billion today.)
